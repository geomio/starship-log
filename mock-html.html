    It Has become hard to breathe, the air grows thinner every minute. I dont have long-
to do this. The datalog has been recorded, who ever finds this, please avoid echo quadrant at all cost!
Binary star system, unstable mass super flares. A super flare killed any crewmembers not in cryo sleep.
According to the cam they cooked fast, like walking inside of a microwave. unfortunately the ship now looks like a melted toy on the outside.

I have been floating for 600 days. I have since added the remnants of crew to the organic recycler. to prolong life systems further.
Please to whom finds this, mark echo quadrant as unstable, please message my daughter this is her glactic id and comm code, 18881881 sector 591-delta-
I regret not getting to see her one last time and she is loved always.
